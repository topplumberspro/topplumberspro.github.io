<p>Once the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial areas in the assembly.

Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so used or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain everything remains in good shape.</p>
