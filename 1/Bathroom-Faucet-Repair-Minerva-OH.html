This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<p>The double check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire defense industry, developing a redundancy designed to ensure that a person check valve will continue to secure the city water system even if the other fails. This assembly likewise allows the closure of one valve to minimize the pressure differential throughout the other, developing a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor backflow leakage.
