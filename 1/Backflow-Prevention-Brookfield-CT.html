When switching to electrical or getting rid of a home appliance, topping a gas line prevents leaks.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different style from the one we reveal, inspect the directions. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to break and solidify or just be so squished that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so used or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape.</p>
