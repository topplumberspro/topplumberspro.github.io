<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close.
