<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to get rid of hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process known as Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a firmness crystal that will not adhere to any surface area in your home, keeping your devices and hot water heaters free of hard water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners due to the fact that they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And since these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate captured ions.</p>
