<p>Most toilets used today operate with a standard gravity flushing style, implying they use the force of the gravity to push the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewer system. Recently, however, toilets utilizing a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in more and more homes. This system uses a vacuum-assisted flushing system to suck the water into the bowl and down into the drains. A downside of this device is that it's a lot more challenging to unblock your toilet were to become clogged.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
<p>If you happen to have a store vac it will be easier to remove the water with it instead.  Often times you may even be able to unclog the drain by holding the nozzle close to the drain as you draw out the water.

Considering that the pipes are simpler to gain access to and replace, it costs less to do the work and takes less time. Then, as your spending plan permits, we can address other locations of the home and slowly replace all of the pipes over an amount of time, instead of at one time.</p>
