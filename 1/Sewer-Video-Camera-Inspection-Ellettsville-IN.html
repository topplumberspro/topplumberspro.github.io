<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Ellettsville IN!</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
