<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
