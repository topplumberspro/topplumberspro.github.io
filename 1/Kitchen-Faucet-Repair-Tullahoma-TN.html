<p>Include an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting spring-loaded, air inlet valve. We'll reveal you three typical gas piping situations. We'll show you one method to make each connection, however there are other similarly genuine ways utilizing typical plumbing parts. Don't be confused by the labels FIP and MIP; they merely represent female pipe threads and male pipe threads, respectively. And when you purchase the parts, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
