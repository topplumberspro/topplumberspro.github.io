<p>Read your insurance coverage policy completely if your polybutylene pipes have stopped working. Make certain you know what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurer will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be denied due to the fact that the basic HO-3 house owners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged period of time." Call your insurance coverage agent and confirm your coverage. As soon as you have reviewed your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered, check with your representative to validate that your understanding is appropriate.</p>
