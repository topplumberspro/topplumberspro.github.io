<p>Amongst the many things that you need routinely and professionally cleaned up, your commercial or residential sewer pipes are not always at the forefront of concern. In contrast to the rest of your home or company, your sewer pipes may appear downright innocuous.

A lot of sink blockages that occur are much deeper than you may think, and the seriousness is so severe that a common store-bought drain cleaner or impromptu home drain cleaning remedy can not fix. Ease of access - If the toilet is in a hard-to-reach area, having access to pipes and even the area behind the tank is limited, so repairs could cost more. A plumber charges $77 per hour (usually), so anything you can do to make repairs easier, the lower the costs.</p>

The drain will gradually slow up until it ends up being completely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in shops have limited efficiency.
