The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on.
