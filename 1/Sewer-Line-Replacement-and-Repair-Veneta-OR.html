<p>Wait until it's installed under the sink if you have to hardwire the system. Keep in mind: It's probably a great idea to shut off power at the breaker now, so as to avoid forgetting to shut it off later on. It's being shocked by a live wire while under a sink if there's anything worse than being stunned by a live wire.

Needed to be outdoors, no restriction on elevation of sprinkler heads, and mounted 18"- 60" above grade at the installed location. If you take a look at your home's plumbing pipes and see stains, discoloration, flaking, little imprints or rust, your pipes are wearing away.
