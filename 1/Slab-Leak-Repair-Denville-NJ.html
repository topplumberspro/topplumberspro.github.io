<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
<p>As hard water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with salt ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, totally free" salt ions are launched into the water. Softer clothes without hard minerals trapped in the material. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the drab gray triggered by hard water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, fixing, replacing and servicing our softener. Value the time and service you send our way. The replacement tank has fixed the issue we were having.</p>
