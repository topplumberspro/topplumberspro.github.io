<p>Lubrication may help with the positioning of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not assist the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the professional assemble the components into the body without developing damage from friction. The lubricant must be a food grade lube to ensure the water system is not infected. In many cases the very best lubricant is water. The typical use for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be gently lubed to assure they do not present of their retainer. The use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out earlier by attracting dirt and particles or limiting the movement of the element. The appropriate quantity of lube should make the surface area of the 'ring appear damp. You ought to never ever see pieces or globs of lubricant.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>If you have a newer system, a basic repair or replacing individual parts may be all that's needed to get your hot water heater working again. You may be lured to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this may work in the short-term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same material as other pipes in your home, implying that problem could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you comfort and avoid bigger leakages down the road.</p>
