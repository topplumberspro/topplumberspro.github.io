<h3>Reverse Osmosis Systems in Eureka Missouri</h2>
<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
