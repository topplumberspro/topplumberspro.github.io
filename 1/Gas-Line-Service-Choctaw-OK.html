<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly restored, the beads become loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions.

The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
