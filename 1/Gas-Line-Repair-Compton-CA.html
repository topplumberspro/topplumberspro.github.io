<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
