<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an every year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested annually to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
