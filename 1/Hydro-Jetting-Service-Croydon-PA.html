<p>In many cases, pipe relining is great alternative to changing your sewer pipes. There are four kinds of pipe relining systems to effectively do the job. All the materials will rehabilitate the interior of your pipes without needing to entirely replace them. How old is the plumbing in your home? Well, first let's ask you a different concern: How old is your house? If it was constructed before 1970, it might have pipes made from an outdated material that will start to offer you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they haven't currently). And if the house was built before World War II, then it almost certainly requires replacements for its old pipes, most likely whole-house repiping.</p>

Installing black iron gas pipe averages $4.89 per direct foot, while installing galvanized steel averages in between $2.19 and $9.33 per linear foot. Both are more labor-intensive than PVC and HDPE piping.
