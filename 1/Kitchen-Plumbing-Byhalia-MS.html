<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
