<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As tough water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. When water is heated, hard water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
