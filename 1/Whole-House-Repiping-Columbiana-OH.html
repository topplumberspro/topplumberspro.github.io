There are likewise numerous price points for brand-new faucets to fit every design and spending plan. The kind of brand-new faucet you choose might be restricted by the variety of pre-drilled holes in your existing bathroom or kitchen counter top. We had some family coming to remain for graduation weekend and we required a new water heater before they got here. We shopped around for a bit, however we got the very best quotes from Blue Frog. They had the ability to send someone out within a day or so. He was really friendly and good. He said our costs should be lower now too.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
