Backflow is the unwanted flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, gasses or compounds into the drinking supply of water. In most states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any natural gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your home or service.

New toilets that include spacious, higher seats feel more like being in a chair, and are much easier to rest on and stand up from, while also providing improved effectiveness.</p>
<p>A reduction in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire battling, triggers the supply pressure to drop listed below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure again goes beyond the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close.
