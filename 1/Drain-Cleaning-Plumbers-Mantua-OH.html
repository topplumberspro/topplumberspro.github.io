<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>More complex is the double check valve assembly (DCVA). This device has actually found widespread usage since it prevents both siphonage and back pressure. The paired check valves are organized in line with the pipeline and run independently of each other. A set of 4 test cocks enable the operator to take a look at the valves and ensure they are not being forced open by collected debris. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at anticipated operational pressure to flow through. Need to backflow happen, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, avoiding the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
