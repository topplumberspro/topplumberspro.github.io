The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" establishments.</p>
