<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best utilized in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
