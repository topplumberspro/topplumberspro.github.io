<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds.
