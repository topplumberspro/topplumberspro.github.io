<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
