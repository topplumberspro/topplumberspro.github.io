When it concerns electrical water heaters, there are 2 main systems; tank and tankless electric heating unit.

<p>Standpipe systems are utilized in many centers, these systems are developed to offer water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets strategically installed inside a building. These systems normally are set up in big, open spaces within buildings, and in multistory buildings for the function of manual firefighting. Standpipe systems can offer early fire suppression in these structures making it capable for a single person or firefighter to provide a efficient and fast response to fire. There are 2 types of standpipe systems, the first type, are dry systems, which normally contain no long-term water system and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire personnel responding to an occurrence. A dry standpipe system needs no backflow prevention protection. The 2nd type is a wet standpipe system which is normally connected to the buildings drinkable water supply and requires the installation of a check valve assembly.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a danger to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
