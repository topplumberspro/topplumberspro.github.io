<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
