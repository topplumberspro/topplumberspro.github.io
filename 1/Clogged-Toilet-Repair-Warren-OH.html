<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe water system system. A malfunctioning garbage disposal, grease buildup, collected food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems.

<p>Replace what's exposed.

Toilets need to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
