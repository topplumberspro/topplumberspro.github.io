<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the exterior. An RPZ will periodically discharge small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>
<p>When you turn your irrigation system on, it's a good idea to evaluate your backflow assembly every spring. Nevertheless, we rarely advise CPVC when an entire house needs repiping.

Some states require steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they might also require an unique license to work on gas lines. Licensing normally needs an examination or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for additional information.</p>
