<p>Conductor piping, when entering a City combination sewer, should be caught, either individually or a single trap not to go beyond 10 inches in diameter. These traps shall consist of a cleanout to grade. Single traps shall be installed, whenever possible, within five feet of the outside of outside walls.

This could be due to a backup of clogged sewage that cant get to the main sewer lines.</p>
<p>If you have a more recent unit, a basic repair or replacing individual parts may be all that's required to get your water heater working once again. You may be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to save money. While this may work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same product as other pipes in your home, indicating that problem could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and avoid bigger leaks down the roadway.</p>
