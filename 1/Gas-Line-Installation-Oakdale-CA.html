<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
