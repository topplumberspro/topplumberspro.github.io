<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to business? The timing of regrowth depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water actually requires it. When required, newer units use electronic sensing units that monitor bead exhaustion and other essential metrics based on your water use and for that reason just regenerate. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
