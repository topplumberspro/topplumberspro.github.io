<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Given that I like to prepare, I create a lot of dishes. We established a short-term workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we recognized that we required the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will stay clog-free for thirty days. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are really delighted that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company once again and again in the future.</p>

<p>Lubrication may assist with the positioning of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any better, it is just there to assist the service technician assemble the parts into the body without producing damage from friction. The lubricant must be a food grade lube to assure the water system is not polluted. Oftentimes the very best lubricant is water. The normal use for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be gently lubed to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer.

The proper quantity of lubricant need to make the surface of the 'ring appear damp. You should never ever see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>
<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
