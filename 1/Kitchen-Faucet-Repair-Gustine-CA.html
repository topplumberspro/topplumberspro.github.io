It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
