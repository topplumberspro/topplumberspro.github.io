<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>

<p>Finally, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in critical locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
