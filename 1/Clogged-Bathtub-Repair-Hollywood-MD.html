<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
