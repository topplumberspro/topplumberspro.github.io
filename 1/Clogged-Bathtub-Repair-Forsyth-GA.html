<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
