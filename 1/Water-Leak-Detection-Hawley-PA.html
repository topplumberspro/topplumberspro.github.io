If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next appointment, they likely rushed the task (unless you have a really small plumbing system). When you contact us to arrange your consultation, ask the length of time the inspection normally takes.</p>
<p>Don't wait till you experience the shock of an unanticipated icy-cold shower prior to requiring plumbing services in Orange County A stopping working hot water heater will typically exhibit specific indications before entirely breaking down.

To remove the old flange, utilize a hacksaw blade or an angle grinder with a metal-cutting wheel. The repair flange is readily available at some house centers, at plumbing supply stores or online (search for bay flange").</p>
