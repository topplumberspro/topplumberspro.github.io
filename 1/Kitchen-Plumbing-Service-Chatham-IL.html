<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. This big quantity of trash does not need to enter the garbage can if it can quickly and rapidly be gotten rid of through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of trash that gets sent out to land fills and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is handled through already existing water facilities.</p>
