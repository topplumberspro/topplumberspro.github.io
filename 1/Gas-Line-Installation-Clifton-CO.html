It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.
