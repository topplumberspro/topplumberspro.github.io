<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Rushville IN</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>As toilets age, they need to work harder to do their jobs. Harder work indicates more water. Even if your toilet operates successfully, it's also possible that it's just an old style that uses a great deal of water. Consider changing your old toilet with a modern-day low-flow model if you're stressed about your water expense. The new low-flow toilets work just as efficiently as any other kind of toilet, and you'll save an unexpected amount on your bill.</p>
