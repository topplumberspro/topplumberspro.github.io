The repair service technician need to be careful to not produce a backsiphonage condition by draining the water from a higher elevations down to lower elevation. If the backflow prevention assembly was installed as a service protection assembly, this backsiphonage condition might lead to a contamination of the plumbing system. Abrams, Paul.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
