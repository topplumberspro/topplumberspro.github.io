<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and offer brighter clothing and softer skin utilizing a healthier approach. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without needing to include salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Standard salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative result on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no drainage, no salt and no electrical power or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last up to 5 years without replacing.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly.
