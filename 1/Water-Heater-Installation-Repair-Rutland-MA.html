<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
<p>There are two great reasons to insist on a sewer camera inspection of your hygienic and storm sewer before buying. , if the house that you have your eye on is an older home in a fully grown neighborhood you most likely have larger trees on or near the property.. Regrettably where there are trees there are normally tree roots and they like to find water inside of your sewer.

You can chance and wait on the very first rainstorm however I believe you 'd rather not.</p>
