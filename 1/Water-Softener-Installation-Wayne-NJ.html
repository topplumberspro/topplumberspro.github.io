Excess putty will eject between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.

For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl.

Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly recommend likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
