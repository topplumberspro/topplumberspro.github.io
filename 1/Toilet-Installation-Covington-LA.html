When it concerns the concern of tough water, a traditional water softener in fact gets rid of calcium, silica and magnesium ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is referred to as momentary firmness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.
