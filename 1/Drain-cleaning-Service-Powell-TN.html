<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in many locations have actually vastly minimized the number of reported events that happen within our water supply. This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever actually have been a problem in the first place. This thinking can be both detrimental and hazardous. Backflow occurrences in water supply are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a lowered pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many areas we have an all or absolutely nothing technique to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the danger it provides and then install the proper defense.</p>
