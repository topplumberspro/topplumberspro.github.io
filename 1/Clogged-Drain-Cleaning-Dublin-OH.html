It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
