The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave.
