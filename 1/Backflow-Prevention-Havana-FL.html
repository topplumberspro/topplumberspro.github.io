<p>Sometimes you understand you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is very important to pinpoint the specific place of the break in your sewer line.

Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the issue.
