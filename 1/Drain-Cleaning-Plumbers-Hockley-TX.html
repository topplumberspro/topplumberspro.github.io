Because they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
