This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close.
