It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.
