While there's not a specific timetable as to when you need to repipe your home, you must certainly look into repiping if they haven't been carried out in 50 years or more-- especially if you live in an older house built closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our a/c unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech discuss what exactly was wrong with the unit, how he repaired the problem, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would highly recommend Hunter for any problems you may have.</p>

The kind of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, plastic, clay or copper, will identify the extent of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break since you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home.
