This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever truly have been an issue in the first place.

Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly advise likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
