<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leaks and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
