<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
