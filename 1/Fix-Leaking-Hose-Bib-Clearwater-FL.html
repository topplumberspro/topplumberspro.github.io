<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
