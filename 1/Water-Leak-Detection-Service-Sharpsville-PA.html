<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
