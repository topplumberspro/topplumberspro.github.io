<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
