<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
