It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. First, plans for each device to be installed should be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may take up to 3 weeks or more to authorize and process. Declined strategies need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can include another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>To assist avoid obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the method set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior size of the tee. This is particularly true when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be checked annually. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated yearly to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
