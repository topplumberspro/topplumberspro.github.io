During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
