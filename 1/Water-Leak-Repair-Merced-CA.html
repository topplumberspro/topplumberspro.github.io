<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
