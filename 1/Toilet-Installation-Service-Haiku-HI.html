<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the simplest of the 3 offered approaches. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This process includes covering Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leaks and deterioration within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier in between the within the pipe and the material flowing through it. This repair approach is more suitable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals. The service technician, Kenny, was polite, professional and useful! He asked me to look at the camera with him then explained my options without attempting to oversell me! I would highly suggest the Clog Dawg for a when or annual inspection if you think that roots may be causing havoc in your drainage pipes.</p>
<p>One way we identify backflow threat is by asking clients to complete a Backflow Assessment Type to collect more information about their water usage.

<p>The law also needs annual testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report sent to the DEP. Failure to comply can result in penalties and termination of water service.

<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
