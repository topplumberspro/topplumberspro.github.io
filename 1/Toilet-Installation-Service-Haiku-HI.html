<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk.
