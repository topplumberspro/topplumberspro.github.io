<p>To help avoid blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of utilize the approach set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle effectively halves the interior size of the tee. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
