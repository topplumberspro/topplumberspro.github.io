<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Brigantine NJ</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Faulty parts: If you have an electrical water heater, a malfunctioning thermostat or a tripped breaker can cause problems. If you have a gas system, the pilot burner may head out, resulting in little or no warm water. In general, traditional water heaters are expected to last 7-10 years with correct maintenance. Check the age of the existing water heater if you're moving into a new home. You do not wish to move into a brand-new home just to find out you're going to need to make a significant plumbing repair in simply a year or 2.</p>
