<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is comprised of numerous mechanical parts which, with time, undergo wear and tear and may need to be replaced.

<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a various design from the one we show, examine the instructions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

We have actually installed a variety of these instant hot water systems and can help you pick the ideal tankless water heater for your particular requirements.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the issue.

At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
