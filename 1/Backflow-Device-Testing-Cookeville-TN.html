<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
