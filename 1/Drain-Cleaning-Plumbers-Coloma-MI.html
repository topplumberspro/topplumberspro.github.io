<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
