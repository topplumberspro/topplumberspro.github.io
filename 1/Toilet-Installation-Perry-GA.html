<p>When it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house, this is one of the main and very first questions that you must ask yourself. The age of your house is a crucial component to understand whether you must repipe your home.

If your home was built before the 1970s, we highly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping.
