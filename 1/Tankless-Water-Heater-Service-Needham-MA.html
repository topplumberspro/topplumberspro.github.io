<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your house. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
