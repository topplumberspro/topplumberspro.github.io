So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
