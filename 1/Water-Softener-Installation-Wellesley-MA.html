<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated annually. Also allows released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated every year to guarantee the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
