<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two telltale signs of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up over time, they gradually start to restrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much buildup to occur, so by the time you see it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
