These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems.

As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily stored for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
