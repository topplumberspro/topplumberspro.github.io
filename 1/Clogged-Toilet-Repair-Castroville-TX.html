<p>During normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the exterior if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will regularly release small amounts of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>

Some states need pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may likewise need a special license to work on gas lines. Licensing typically requires an exam or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for more details.</p>
