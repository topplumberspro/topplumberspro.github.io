<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and industrial applications, including the prevention of limescale accumulation in families and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, along with improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is simpler and more economical than other softening systems on the market today that use zeolites, which need to be regrowed using salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that requires considerable water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up with time, they slowly start to constrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure.

Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
