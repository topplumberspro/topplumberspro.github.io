<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads become loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Hard water triggers white or gray deposits when water is warmed. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these signs.</p>
