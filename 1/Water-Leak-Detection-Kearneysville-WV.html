Your plumbing system is only designed for water to move in one direction, but if there's a sudden change in pressure inside the pipes, it can cause the water to flow the incorrect way.

The riser needs to be strongly attached to sturdy rebar or wooden stake to add structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is significantly total is prohibited unless a check backflow assembly is installed and immediately evaluated to guarantee it is working.</p>
