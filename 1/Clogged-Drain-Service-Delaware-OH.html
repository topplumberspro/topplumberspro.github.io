<p>We focus on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Softened water is not advised for watering home yards, gardens and plants due to its sodium material. Water utilized in recharging a water softener might overload or reduce the effectiveness of small septic or sewer systems. Sodium consumption might posture health risks. Softened water is not suggested for steam irons or evaporative coolers. The best choice for such home appliances is distilled water or water from a reverse osmosis system.
