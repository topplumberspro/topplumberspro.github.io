<p>Those of us in the market know that cross-connection programs in many areas have actually vastly lowered the number of reported incidents that take place within our water systems. This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there may never truly have actually been a concern in the first location. This thinking can be both disadvantageous and unsafe. Backflow events in water systems are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.
