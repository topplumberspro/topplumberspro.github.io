They then place a new replacement pipe on one end and pull it through the old pipe's path utilizing a hydraulic machine. This triggers the old pipe to burst or split in order to replace it with a new, more powerful, extremely long lasting and leak-resistant sewer pipe without having to collect the old one initially.</p>
