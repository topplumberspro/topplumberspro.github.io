<p>For the function of water treatment, hardness is measured in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is defined as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) liquified in one US gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is specified as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To convert in between gpg and ppm utilize the list below factor; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm.
