The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to escape.

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
