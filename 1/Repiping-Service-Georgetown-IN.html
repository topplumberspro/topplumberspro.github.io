<p>Irrigation backflow gadgets are created for installation on drinkable water lines to protect against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the safe and clean supply of water. While there's not a precise schedule as to when you ought to repipe your home, you should absolutely check out repiping if they have not been performed in 50 years or more-- specifically if you live in an older house developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our ac system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe just what was wrong with the system, how he repaired the problem, and how to avoid a reaccuance. I would highly suggest Hunter for any concerns you might have.</p>
