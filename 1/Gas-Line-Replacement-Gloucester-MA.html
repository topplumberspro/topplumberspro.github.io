<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). If your valve is a different style from the one we reveal, check the directions. After mounting the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
