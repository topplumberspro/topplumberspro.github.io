This is required to support the plumbing system and guarantee the structural integrity.

<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best used in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
