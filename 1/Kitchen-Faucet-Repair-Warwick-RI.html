<p>A typical water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell. From brand-new bathroom components to custom counter tops, we truly have everything. Our inventory makes us the very best plumbing company for any job in Seattle, WA.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a procedure called ion exchange to get rid of hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical process referred to as Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that will not stay with any surface in your home, keeping your devices and hot water heaters devoid of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise known as water conditioners since they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate captured ions.</p>

Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require less repairs gradually.
