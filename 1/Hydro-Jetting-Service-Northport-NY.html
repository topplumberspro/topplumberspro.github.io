The drip pan is set up under the water heater in order to gather any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the home or into an appropriate drain.

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force.

That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>
