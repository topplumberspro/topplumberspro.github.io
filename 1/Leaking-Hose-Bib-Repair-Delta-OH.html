<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
