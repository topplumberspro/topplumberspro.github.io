<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed. As difficult water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Hard water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
