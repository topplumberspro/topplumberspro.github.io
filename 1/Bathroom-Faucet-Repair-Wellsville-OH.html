<p>Rust in the hot water heater tank - Rust can be a big problem for hot water heater, positioning a danger for corrosion and contamination of your water.

We have portable electric systems for within your house or organisation and large gas and trailer units for exterior problems.

<p>There are 2 popular install systems used for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt mount (if you've had a disposer installed for some time, it's most likely installed this way) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the same job with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name indicates, the EZ Mount mechanism is planned to be easier to deal with when repairing an unit or installing.</p>

Other good options are overload protection, which turns off the motor if it begins to get too hot; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the filthy meals get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic system, you'll need a disposal specifically developed to be used with a septic tank. provides an overview 1 of waste disposal unit and septic systems.</p>
