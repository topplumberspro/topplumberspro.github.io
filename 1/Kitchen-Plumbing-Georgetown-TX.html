I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
