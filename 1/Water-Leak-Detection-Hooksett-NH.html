<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
