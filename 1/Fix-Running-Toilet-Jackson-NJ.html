A softener is comprised of various elements, each having their own special function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel typically constructed out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with negatively charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is commonly referred to.
