<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the approach laid out above. Because the baffle efficiently halves the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially real when the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
