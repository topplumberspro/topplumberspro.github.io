<p>A leaking toilet is another common problem homeowners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak. This problem is often triggered by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as simple as a worn out flapper valve. A drip pan is economical and effective. The drip pan is set up under the water heater in order to gather any extraneous dripping water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the home or into a suitable drain. A perfect time to replace or install a drip pan is when the hot water heater is being replaced.</p>
