<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly restored, the beads end up being filled with salt ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, hard water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these symptoms.</p>
