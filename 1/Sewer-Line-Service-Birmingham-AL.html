<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
