<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many intended uses around your house.</p>
