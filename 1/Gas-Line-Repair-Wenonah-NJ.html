<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>A toilet that runs non-stop is annoying, but it can also cost you a great deal of money. Without toilet repair, it's like you're flushing money down the toilet! Generally, this problem is quite simple to fix by fixing the toilet's inner workings. Boiling difficult water causes calcium and magnesium minerals to speed up out of water and onto your kettle. This sounds unusual due to the fact that normally heat makes solids dissolve faster - however when it comes to salts which make your water tough - it's the opposite.</p>
