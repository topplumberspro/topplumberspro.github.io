<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Aldie VA</h3>
<p>If your home uses around 45 gallons of hot water every day, the on-demand gas heater can conserve as much as 35% of the energy required for heated water. They can also minimize the energy required for homes with far greater needs too. Residences that use over 80 gallons of warm water every day can conserve as much as 14% by changing to these smaller sized water heaters. It is approximated that an average family can save as much as $100 each year by changing to the tankless heater.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a different style from the one we reveal, inspect the instructions. After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
