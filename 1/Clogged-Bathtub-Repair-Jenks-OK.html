<p>The nationwide typical cost to repair a leaking faucet is $65-$ 150, however the cost might be higher, depending on the nature and reason for the leak. Common water heater problems consist of lukewarm or cold water, a leaking tank or scalding water. The reason for these concerns can be difficult to identify, so it is very important to hire a professional plumbing contractor who is familiar with the knowledge needed to find the issue and make the suitable repairs.</p>
<p>Your sewer line issue can lead to sewer backups, and they normally happen in the lowest open drain. This type of issue is usually the outcome of a clog in the line. If you don't find the smell coming from the sewer backup, you might determine this problem since a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, nevertheless, only one drain has backup problems, there's a separated problem with just that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
