It will be better to live with a brand-new, more efficient system than to spend on frequent repairs.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
