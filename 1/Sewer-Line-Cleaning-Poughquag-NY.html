<p>A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell. From new bathroom fixtures to customized countertops, we truly have it all. Our inventory makes us the best plumbing company for any task in Seattle, WA.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which use a process called ion exchange to remove difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical process called Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This procedure converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that won't adhere to any surface area in your home, keeping your devices and warm water heaters without tough water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And due to the fact that these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove recorded ions.</p>
