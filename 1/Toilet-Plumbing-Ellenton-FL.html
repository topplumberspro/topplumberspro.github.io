<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
