<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
