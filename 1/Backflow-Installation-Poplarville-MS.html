<p>Run the hot water. Hot water is your friend, particularly for your kitchen sink.

Running the warm water after you've used your sink helps clear particles and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear. Funneling happens when the inbound hard water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you have actually ever noticed that the busier your business is, the better your detergent works, the perpetrator could be an oversized softener.</p>

The technology is easier and more cost-efficient than other softening systems on the market today that utilize zeolites, which need to be regrowed using salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that needs significant water usage and high pressure.</p>
