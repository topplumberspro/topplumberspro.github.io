<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
