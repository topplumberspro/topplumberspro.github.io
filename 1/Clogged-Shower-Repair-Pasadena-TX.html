<p>Pipeline video inspection is a form of telepresence utilized to visually examine the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to identify the condition of little diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
