<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Double flush valves are ending up being increasingly more common, as both manufacturers and customers seek new methods to save water. Double flush toilets permit the user to choose the level of water required to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is liquid or solid.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
