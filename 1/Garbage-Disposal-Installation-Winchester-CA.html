<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
