Water leaks: If you see a leak in your pipes, there might be other leakages you are uninformed of. Leaks are a sure indication that your pipes are used and old and need to be changed.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.
