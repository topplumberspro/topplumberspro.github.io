<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman thought the cost she paid for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things in a different way could have conserved her a great deal of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure.
