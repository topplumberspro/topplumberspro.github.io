<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
