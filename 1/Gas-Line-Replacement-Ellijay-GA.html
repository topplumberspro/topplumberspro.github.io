<p>Foundation fractures. A damaged main sewer line is more than just a plumbing problem; it can trigger excellent structural damage to your home. Broken sewer lines left unattended in time can result in fractures in your house's foundation, a settled structure, or even sinkholes. If your water heater is not working effectively, you can have it repaired and extend its service life with routine maintenance depending on your make and the quality of the installation.</p>

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I love to cook, I produce a great deal of meals. We set up a short-term workaround at our guest bathroom sink, however after a day of this we realized that we needed the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within thirty minutes and he guarantees that the sink will remain clog-free for 1 month. If it clogs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely happy that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly use this company again and once again in the future.</p>

Water leaks: If you observe a leak in your pipes, there might be other leakages you are uninformed of. Leakages are a sure sign that your pipes are old and worn and need to be replaced. Rather than needing to continually repair them, the very best alternative. is to replace them.</p>

There's the normal nervousness about electrical power and water, the unknown sink connection and enough drain fittings to make leakages a real possibility.

And finally, failed disposers don't often leak, a minimum of not in the beginning, so it's simple to put things off.</p>
