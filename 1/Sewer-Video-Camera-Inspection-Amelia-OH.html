<p>. Leaking Joints: The seals between pipes have rotted or broken, enabling water to leave into the ground surrounding the pipes. Examine the sewer lines from home to curb connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to thoroughly check if pipe damage, deterioration, or significant clogs are present. Tree roots are one of the most significant causes of a sewer line backup. As roots enter into the drain line they can cause blockages and back up into your house.</p>

Dealing with fixing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the savings sustained from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
