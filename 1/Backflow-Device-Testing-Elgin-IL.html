<h3>How to Save Water With Leak Detection Awareness in Elgin IL</h3>

<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different style from the one we reveal, examine the directions. After mounting the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
