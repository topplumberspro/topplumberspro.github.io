<p>A typical water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to remove hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical procedure known as Design template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a hardness crystal that won't stay with any surface in your house, keeping your home appliances and warm water heaters devoid of hard water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners since they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it.
