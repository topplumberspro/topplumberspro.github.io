<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure utilized to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.

Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any leftover pollutants.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
