<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
