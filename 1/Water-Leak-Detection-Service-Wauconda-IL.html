<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Wauconda IL</h3>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner package. The total repair expense might be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the new heater.
