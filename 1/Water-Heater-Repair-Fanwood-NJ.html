<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>
