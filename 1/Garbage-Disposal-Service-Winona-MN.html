<p>Water discoloration: Another apparent sign of your pipes rotting is yellow or brown water coming out of your sinks or tub. Our service technicians are drain and sewer professionals due to the fact that we train them ourselves in our own internal training center.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
