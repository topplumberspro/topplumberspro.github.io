<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" facilities.</p>
