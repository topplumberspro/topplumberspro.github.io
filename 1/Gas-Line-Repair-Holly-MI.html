<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. But finding the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are typically available at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to discover. Remove it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
