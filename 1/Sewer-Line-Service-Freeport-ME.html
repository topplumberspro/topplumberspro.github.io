The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
