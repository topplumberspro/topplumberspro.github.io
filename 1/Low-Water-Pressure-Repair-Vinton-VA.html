<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
