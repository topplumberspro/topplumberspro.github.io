These minerals can vary depending upon which area of the country you're in, but most typically consist of calcium, magnesium, bicarbonates, and sulfates. Difficult water doesn't start hard-- instead, it gets mineral deposits as it is available in contact with limestone underground. These mineral deposits stay when the water is routed into pipes for residential and commercial usage, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
