In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while liquified solids are captured and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated every year to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
