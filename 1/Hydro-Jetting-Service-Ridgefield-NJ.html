<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are captured and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>A. We highly advise a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers obstruct any water from back or unfavorable pressure in your watering system at shutdown from getting in back into your water source, hence minimizing the danger of contamination of your water source. Lots of municipalities need using an approved backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You may want to talk to your local municipality prior to installing your watering system.</p>
