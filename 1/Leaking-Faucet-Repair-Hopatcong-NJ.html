Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners due to the fact that they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of caught ions.</p>
