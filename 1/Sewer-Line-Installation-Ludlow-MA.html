<p>You'll need an unique waste disposal unit if you home uses a septic tank and drain field. The system should grind the waste even finer to prevent blockages and allow the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, however needs to then shift to galvanized. I am not sure why that should be. It is also enabled to utilize black iron if it is probably covered with a galvanized coating (which is generally an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E often does this.</p>
