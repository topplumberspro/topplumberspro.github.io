<p>More than manpower is required to unclog a drain. Your local plumber needs to have the right equipment to get the job done. We utilize every type of drain cleaning machine out there, varying from small hand snakes to drain machines capable of clearing huge sewer mains. Among the most powerful devices we have is the cable television drain cleaning machine, likewise called the 'drain snake'. This machine clears drains and sewage systems by turning a versatile cable television made of wire through the pipe. Attachments at the end of the cable help the process by scraping, boring, cutting pipe blockages like roots and sludge. Every kind of pipe blockage is various and requires knowledge of the proper size cable television and the right cutting head.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas beverages. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a risk to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
