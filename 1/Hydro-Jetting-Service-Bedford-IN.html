<h3>Plumbing Services Around Bedford IN</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
