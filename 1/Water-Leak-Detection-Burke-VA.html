<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
