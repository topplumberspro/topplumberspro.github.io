<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the easiest of the three available methods. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This process includes finishing Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leakages and rust within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the inside of the material and the pipe flowing through it. This repair method is preferable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals. The specialist, Kenny, was courteous, professional and useful! He asked me to look at the camera with him then explained my options without trying to oversell me!
