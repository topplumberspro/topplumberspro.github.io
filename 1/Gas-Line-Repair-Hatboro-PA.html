<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
