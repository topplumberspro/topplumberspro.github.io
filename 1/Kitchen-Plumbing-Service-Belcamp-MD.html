This process converts the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that will not stay with any surface in your house, keeping your devices and warm water heaters free of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise known as water conditioners because they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to remove caught ions.</p>
