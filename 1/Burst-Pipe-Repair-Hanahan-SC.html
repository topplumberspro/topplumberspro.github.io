<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Hanahan SC</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system needs to be constantly monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Clogs are quickly prevented with a few key steps. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers catch hair, food and other debris before it gets stuck, avoiding the need of drain cleaning. Although they do not capture everything, it helps the system considerably.
