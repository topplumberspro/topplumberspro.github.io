<p>The next step for an ambitious plumbing contractor is to make a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing service and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors normally consist of paying an application fee and passing an extensive business, law and building regulations exam. Some community colleges and technical schools provide contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Extra requirements for potential plumbing business owners may consist of evidence of financial reliability, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Again, it is a good idea to examine the maker's instructions for unique preventative measures.</p>
