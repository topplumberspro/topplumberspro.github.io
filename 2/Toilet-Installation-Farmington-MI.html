<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Farmington MI</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested yearly. Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be evaluated yearly to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
