<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>

Repiping now will provide you assurance and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>
