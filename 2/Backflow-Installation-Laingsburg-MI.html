Claims may be rejected due to the fact that the standard HO-3 house owners' policy specifically omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged amount of time." Call your insurance agent and validate your coverage. Double check with your agent to verify that your understanding is proper as soon as you have actually read through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
