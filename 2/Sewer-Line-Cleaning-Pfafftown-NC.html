<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will cause your water to look brown or rusty, and the water might have a bad or foul smell to it. When the piping in your house starts to show any of these indications of deterioration, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system. The factor a toilet will not flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain underneath the toilet can also be the cause.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
