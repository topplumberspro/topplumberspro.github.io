<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
