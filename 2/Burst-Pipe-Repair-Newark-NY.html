Lots of obstructions are triggered by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Understand how much toilet tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever position any paper item into the toilet bowl besides toilet paper. Paper towels can quickly stop up the toilet drain line or cause a clog further down the drainpipe.
