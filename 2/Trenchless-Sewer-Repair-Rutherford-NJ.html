<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
