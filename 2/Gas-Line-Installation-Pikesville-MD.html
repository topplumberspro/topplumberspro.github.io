<p>You'll need a special waste disposal unit if you home utilizes a septic system and drain field. The system must grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and allow the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. Once, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then transition to galvanized. I am unsure why that must be. It is also enabled to use black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized coating (which is essentially an unique paint"). PG&E frequently does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
<p>Once the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
