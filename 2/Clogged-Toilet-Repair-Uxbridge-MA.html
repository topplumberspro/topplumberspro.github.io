<p>Last but not least, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best used in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>

Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it.
