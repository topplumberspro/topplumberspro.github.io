<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
