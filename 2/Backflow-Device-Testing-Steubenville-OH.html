<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
