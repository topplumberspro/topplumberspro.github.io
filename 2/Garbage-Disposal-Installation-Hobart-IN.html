<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a procedure called ion exchange to get rid of hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical procedure known as Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC).

Salt-free softeners are likewise referred to as water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it.
