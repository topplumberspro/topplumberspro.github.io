<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older home (built pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing, this is a choice to think about. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, but steel eventually struggles with corrosion and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
