This issue is typically brought on by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn flapper valve. A drip pan is efficient and low-cost. The drip pan is installed under the hot water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into a suitable drain.
