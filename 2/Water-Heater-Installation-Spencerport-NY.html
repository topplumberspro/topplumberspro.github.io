<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
