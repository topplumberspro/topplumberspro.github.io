<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in numerous areas have greatly decreased the variety of reported occurrences that take place within our water supply. This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there may never really have actually been a problem in the first place. This thinking can be both hazardous and detrimental. Backflow occurrences in water systems are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the threat it presents and after that install the correct protection.</p>

<p>An easy repair or replacing individual parts might be all that's required to get your water heater working again if you have a more recent unit.

Repiping now will give you peace of mind and avoid larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
