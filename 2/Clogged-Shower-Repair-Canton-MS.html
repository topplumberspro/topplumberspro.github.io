New meters need to fulfill regulations and code requirements for their placement, and gas providers may need a distinct meter for their services, limiting your options. Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number listed on the structure license. Inspections must be made after structure excavation (before putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon conclusion.
