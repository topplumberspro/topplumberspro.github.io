<p>When a repiping service is required, this involves getting rid of damaged sections of old piping and installing brand-new piping in its location. This is necessary to stabilize the plumbing system and ensure the structural integrity. Copper piping has been the standard for several years and is typically considered as the premier type of repiping. We utilize Type L" copper, which is the leading grade of copper. Our company believe that if you are going to invest in copper piping, do it once, do it right.</p>
<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
