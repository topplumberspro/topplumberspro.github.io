Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be tested occasionally to ensure they are operating effectively. A visual check of air spaces suffices, however mechanical backflow preventers need to be evaluated with appropriately adjusted gauge devices.</p>
<p>It is common for hot water heater to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve becomes part of the unit for that exact factor. However while little drips need to not be trigger for concern, property owners must keep an eye on the hot water heater leakages.
