<p>Read your insurance policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have actually failed. Make sure you know what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurer will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be rejected because the basic HO-3 house owners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended period of time." Call your insurance agent and validate your protection. Once you have actually read through your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered, check with your agent to verify that your understanding is correct.</p>
<p>Your first step is to shut off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve.
