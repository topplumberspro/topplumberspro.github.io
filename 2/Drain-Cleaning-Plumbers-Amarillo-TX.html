<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable water system and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be installed. An approved, correctly set up and maintained backflow assembly essentially removes the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity. Still, the difference is inadequate to make any significant modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electric choice will last about 8-12 years.</p>
