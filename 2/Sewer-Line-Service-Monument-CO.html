<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
