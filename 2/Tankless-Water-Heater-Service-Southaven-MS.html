If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you should require to secure yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
