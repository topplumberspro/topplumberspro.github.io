<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly stored for later use when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
