<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to business? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water really requires it. When required, newer systems use computerized sensors that keep track of bead exhaustion and other key metrics based on your water usage and for that reason just regenerate. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal due to the fact that they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
