Copper is a biostatic material, which indicates bacteria will not grow on it. Copper has been utilized (in addition to PVC pipes) given that the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings. It is particularly helpful for cold and hot faucet water and refrigerant lines in A/C systems.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations released after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested annually. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested yearly to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
