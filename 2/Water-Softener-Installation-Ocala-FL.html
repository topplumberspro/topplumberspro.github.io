<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
