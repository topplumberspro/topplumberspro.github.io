Today, it's approximated that over 50% of American homes have a waste disposal unit in their kitchen. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus offers you an optional Pipe Defense Plan for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, easily available, gas pipes running from the gas meter to your natural gas devices.</p>
