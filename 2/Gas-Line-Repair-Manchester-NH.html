<p>Over time, like any other appliance in your home, your waste disposal unit. might need repairs. A disposal system might clog or start to leak through heavy, or incorrect, use. A leak somewhere in the system may indicate a used seal. In many cases, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the entire system.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that should also be well maintained to assist avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to harden and split or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the area as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
