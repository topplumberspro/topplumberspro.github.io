<p>Salt consumption from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or environmental factors demand limiting salt, substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be suitable. Gradually, the beads become covered with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has 3 cycles: rinse, backwash and recharge. The regeneration process can be scheduled immediately with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
