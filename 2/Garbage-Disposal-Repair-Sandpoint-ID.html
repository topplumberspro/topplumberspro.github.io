<p>Pipeline leak detection is utilized to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has actually happened in systems which consist of gases and liquids. Most steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually get 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, in addition to some technical instruction, each year. Technical instruction consists of security, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and organisations. A lot of apprentices go into a program directly, but some start out as assistants or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
