<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it need to be much less water.</p>
