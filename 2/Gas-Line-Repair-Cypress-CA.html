Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water features are considered a health threat if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place should be suggested on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond must be tested upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
<p>A couple of local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the luxury of the irrigated area. It might not be set up in any area where it might ever be submerged under water. Some municipalities do not allow the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some do not enable the use of a PVB at all, so talk to your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out of under the cap when backflow happens, so it must be installed in a place where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
