<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
