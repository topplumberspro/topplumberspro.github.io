<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Souderton PA</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about a Pentair item or concerns about your water, our customer care group is here to assist you. PVC piping installation averages in between $0.22 and $1.55 per direct foot, compared to the typical installation cost of HDPE of $0.99 per linear foot.
