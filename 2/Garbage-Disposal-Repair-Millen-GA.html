We've also helped many others modify their sink designs in their restrooms and kitchen areas to make the area more lovely and useful.

<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two telltale signs of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up over time, they slowly begin to restrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much accumulation to happen, so by the time you see it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
