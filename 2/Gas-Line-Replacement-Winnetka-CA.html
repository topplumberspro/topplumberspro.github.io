<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any leftover pollutants.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instantaneous hot shower that utilizes the point-of-use hot water heater; these devices will supply warm water continuously for the period you are utilizing the shower. They will stop to work just if there are power problems or if the water heater is malfunctioning.
