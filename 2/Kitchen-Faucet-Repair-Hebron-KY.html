<p>Due to incorrect home appliance installation or a gas line hookup that was not done correctly. Getting a new one is more affordable if the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one. Plumbing and piping technology has enhanced over the last 30 years. Copper has been the favored option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which utilized to be considered really strong, but they were found to break under pressure and tend to rust within a couple of years). Today, many quality contractors utilize PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it frequently becomes corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. Most residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it.
