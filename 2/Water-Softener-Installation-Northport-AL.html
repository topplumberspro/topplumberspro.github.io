<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As difficult water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is heated, tough water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>

<p>Cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the waste disposal unit because they can impede the blades.

Baffles: Baffles avoid flatware from getting in the waste disposal unit, so you're only sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
