<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your house. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
<p>The garbage disposal is humming, however not turning. The waste disposal unit has actually ended up being jammed. IF IT IS JAMMED, NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL.

Try to place a broom plunger or deal with into the sink drain opening and try to turn the jammed flywheel if you can't find this wrench.
