This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is required to overcome the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming.

Additionally, a barometric loop will not avoid back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
