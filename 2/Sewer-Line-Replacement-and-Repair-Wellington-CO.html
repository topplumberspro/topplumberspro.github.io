<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
