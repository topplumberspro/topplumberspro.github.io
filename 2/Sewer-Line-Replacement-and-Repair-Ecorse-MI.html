<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation.

That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
