Short-lived water will be enabled after the contractor sets up a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker must be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker need to be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser should be securely connected to sturdy rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is substantially complete is prohibited unless a double check backflow assembly is installed and instantly tested to assure it is working.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
