<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
