I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
