<p>To assist prevent blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the technique set out above. Since the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially real when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free.
