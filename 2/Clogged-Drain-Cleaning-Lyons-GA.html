<p>Unfortunately, there is a large range of things that can clog drain lines, typically without us even learning about it. While blockages are marked by gross smells and slow water circulation, they may lead to more severe problems, too, like bursting and back-ups. Protect your drains, and remember to call High 5 Plumbing to take care of clogs As Soon As Possible. Worms for irrigation systems: Citizens discovered parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the atmospheric pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground lawn sprinkler.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer sodas beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
