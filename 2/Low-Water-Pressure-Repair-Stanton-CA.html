<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.

Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any remaining contaminants.</p>
