<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Mchenry IL</h3>

When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
