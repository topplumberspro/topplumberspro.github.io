This is necessary to stabilize the plumbing system and guarantee the structural integrity. Copper piping has been the requirement for many years and is normally deemed the premier kind of repiping. We utilize Type L" copper, which is the leading grade of copper. We believe that if you are going to purchase copper piping, do it when, do it right.</p>
<p>Lubrication may help with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the professional assemble the parts into the body without developing damage from friction. The lubricant must be a food grade lube to guarantee the water supply is not contaminated. In a lot of cases the very best lubricant is water. The usual use for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be gently oiled to ensure they do not present of their retainer. The use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to use or fail out quicker by drawing in dirt and debris or restricting the movement of the element. The correct amount of lube ought to make the surface area of the 'ring appear damp. You ought to never ever see chunks or globs of lube.</p>

Just like our trenchless services, we will first conduct pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
