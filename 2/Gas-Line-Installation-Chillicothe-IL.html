Big Blue Plumbing can manage the permit and buy process. Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, use or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be evaluated occasionally to ensure they are functioning properly. A visual check of air spaces is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers have to be tested with appropriately adjusted gauge devices.</p>

Each achieve the same task with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name implies, the EZ Mount mechanism is planned to be much easier to handle when fixing an unit or installing.</p>
