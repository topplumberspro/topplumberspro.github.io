<h3>Seven Signs You Need a Professional Sewer Cleaning at Belchertown MA</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey.

While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many intended uses around your home.</p>

If your toilet blocks more than once a month-or even when a week!- it's most likely since mineral deposits have actually developed around the top of the drain or in the drain pipes themselves.</p>
