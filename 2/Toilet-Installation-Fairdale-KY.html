<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it difficult to access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, replacing exposed pipes in a crawlspace, basement, or energy  room is relatively simple, since the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets should absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
