When the pipes start to wear away, it impacts your water system. Contaminated water is a health hazard and need to be dealt with rapidly. Rust can also split, break, or burst pipes and ruin your walls or floors. We fix small leaks without repiping, but if you experience persistent leak or a slab leak, it might be time for a total plumbing overhaul.</p>
<p>Often a garbage disposal simply ceases to work and you can't find out the cause. Waste disposal unit problems can be credited to a variety of possible problems. The disposal might be clogged or jammed with an item that is hard to grasp or find, and many property owners watch out for trying to fix a waste disposal unit themselves (and for great factor!). The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing information. Examine the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
