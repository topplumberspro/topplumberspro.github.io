<p>Normal causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root invasion, obstructions (such as foreign objects, toilet tissue, grease, and other particles), deterioration, and broken seals or joints in between sections of sewer line. House owners are accountable for maintaining, fixing, and replacing gas pipes that run from the utility's gas meter to the home's natural gas devices. When the source of a gas leak or other problem is on a client's gas pipe or associated connections, repair costs can be high.</p>
