<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two indicators of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate with time, they gradually begin to restrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much accumulation to happen, so by the time you discover it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>
