<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and offer brighter clothing and softer skin using a healthier approach. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the capability to soften water without having to add salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Conventional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have an unfavorable result on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and use no waste water, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals.
