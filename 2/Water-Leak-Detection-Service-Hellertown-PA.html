<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
