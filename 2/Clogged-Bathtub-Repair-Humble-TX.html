<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>
