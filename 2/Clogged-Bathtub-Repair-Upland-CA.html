If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
