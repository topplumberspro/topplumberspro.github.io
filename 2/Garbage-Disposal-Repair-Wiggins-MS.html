<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
