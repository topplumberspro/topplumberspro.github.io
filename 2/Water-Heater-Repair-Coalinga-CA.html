    <meta name="description" content="24 Hours Plumbing Repairs Coalinga California - One tip for filling your gas tank is to avoid filling up if a fuel tanker is filling the underground tanks at the gas station you pull up to. The gas tanker is filling the underground tanks that supply the pumps with fuel, and as the underground tanks get filled the sediment at the bottom of the giant tank is getting stirred around and mixed with the new fuel being added, making it more likely that the fuel coming from the pumps contains some of the sediment that will then be transferred to your gas tank.">

<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
