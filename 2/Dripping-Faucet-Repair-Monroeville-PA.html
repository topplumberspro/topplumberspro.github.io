<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
