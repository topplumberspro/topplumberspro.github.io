<p>Unless your bathroom renovation is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might very well belong to your project requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which brings in the positively charged minerals in the water (a process known as, ion exchange). The mineral deposits cling to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout the house. Tankless innovation makes sense. As soon as you understand the advantages, it's simple to see why house owners in Charlotte, North Carolina, pick these items over traditional water tanks.
