<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
