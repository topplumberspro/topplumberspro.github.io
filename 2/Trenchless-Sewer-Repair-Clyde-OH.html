If you have children, you may not wish to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>. The size of the population likewise affects water demand. According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The mean per capita water use daily is greater in rural counties than city counties in all the environment regions, other than in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with backwoods having less efficient supply of water systems2 mainly due to the relative absence of funds to update and maintain their systems. So, the greater per capita usage" of water in backwoods might consist of considerable non-revenue water losses from their circulation pipelines. Such issues also factor into the need for backflow preventers at the points of usage.</p>
