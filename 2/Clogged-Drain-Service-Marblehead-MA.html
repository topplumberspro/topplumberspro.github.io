<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future.

A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
