<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to leave. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic design of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an extremely low circulation or fixed flow condition may trigger problem leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.

This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
