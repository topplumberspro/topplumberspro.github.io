Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
