Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that result. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
