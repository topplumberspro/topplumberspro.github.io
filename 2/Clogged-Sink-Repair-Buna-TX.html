It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
