Garbage disposal guarantees last an average of 5 years, however they can vary between 2 and ten years. Given that the typical life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you may wish to purchase a prolonged warranty. Most warranties cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To prevent more breakdowns, property owners need to stay up to date with routine maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
