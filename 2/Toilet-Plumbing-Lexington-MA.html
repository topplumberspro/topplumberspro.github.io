The test duration shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will withstand the test pressure defined without showing any proof of leakage or other defects.

For instance, a 3 psi test will need a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be carried out using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not indicate the minimum pressure required for the test, or any decrease of test pressures as suggested by pressure evaluates throughout inspection shall be considered to suggest the existence of a leak.</p>
