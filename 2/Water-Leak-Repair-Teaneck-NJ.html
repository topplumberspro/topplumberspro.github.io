<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
