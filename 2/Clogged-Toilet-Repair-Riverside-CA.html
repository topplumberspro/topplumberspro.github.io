Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair likewise called trenchless pipe lining is a durable and exceptional option for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining procedure includes our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pressed through your pipeline when the felt liner is completely filled.
