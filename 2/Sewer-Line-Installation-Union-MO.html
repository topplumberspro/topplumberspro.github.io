<p>To assist prevent clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of utilize the approach laid out above. Since the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially real when the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
