Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Gardiner ME</h3>
<p>When a water system is being de-pressurized for a repair, it is important to ensure a backflow condition is not produced. The repair technician must beware to not produce a backsiphonage condition by draining pipes the water from a higher elevations down to lower elevation. This backsiphonage condition might lead to a contamination of the plumbing system if the backflow prevention assembly was installed as a service defense assembly. Abrams, Paul. "Journalist Center" Roto-Rooter Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Service. Obtained 2006-10-08.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
