<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
