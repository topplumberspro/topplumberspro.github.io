<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
