<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the beginning of our home enhancements. George and Anthony did an amazing job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific needs for our home. I will always use them and request for George specifically for all future problems or repairs. They were timely and gave excellent pricing for what we needed done. I highly advise this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>Regenerate your softener with potassium chloride rather of sodium chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is readily available at many shops that offer softener salt. Since the softener's brine tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space. Clogged blockage and drainage problems may start as small concerns but can rapidly speed up into significant concerns. A clogged drain can even result in slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and pricey repairs.</p>
<p>Simply call your friendly Addarios customer support agent or schedule a consultation online and we'll exist with our very same day service assurance to fix your warm water heater. Higher horse power: Horse power (HP) measures how effective a garbage disposal is. Waste disposal unit HP ranges from 1/3 to 1, however for a lot of single-family houses a 1/2 or 3/4 HP system will work just fine. If you have a large family or do a lot of cooking, you might consider a 1 HP garbage disposal.</p>
