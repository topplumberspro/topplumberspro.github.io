Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
