<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>And depending upon the configuration of your home, the plumber may be able to access the large bulk of your system in this manner. For a 1,500 square-foot, two-bathroom house, you'll pay between $2,000 and $6,000 or more to replace simply the exposed plumbing. Since you have to move rapidly in the face of a gas leak, having a plumbing company on hand that you can call is important.
