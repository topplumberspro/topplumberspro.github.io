When it comes to the concern of tough water, a conventional water softener actually removes magnesium, silica and calcium ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is known as temporary firmness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
