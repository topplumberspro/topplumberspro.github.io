This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
