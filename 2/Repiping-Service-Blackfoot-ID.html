The efficiency of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. Learn if there are any lead pipes in the home. Houses that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing.

You may not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>

PEX is easy to install, which implies the cost of installation may be low also. There is some risk of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is rare. In basic, it's a cost-efficient solution that will stand the test of time. We often advise this product, though it will depend.</p>
