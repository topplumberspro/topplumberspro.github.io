<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house.

If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). If your valve is a different style from the one we reveal, check the instructions.
