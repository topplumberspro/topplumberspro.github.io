An excellent guideline for hot water heater is this: because the life-span of the average hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
