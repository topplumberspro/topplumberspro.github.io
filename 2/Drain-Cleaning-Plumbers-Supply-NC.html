<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Supply NC?</h3>
<p>You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the same thing, but without the zinc covering. The zinc finishing on galvanized pipe for gas is indicated to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with wetness. While it does its job pretty well, over time, it still does corrode. If you are currently experiencing clogged drains, we can assist! When one or more of your drains are clogged, water will frequently begin to back up into your sink, which can result in unusual smells. A blocked drain can also cause problems when flushing the toilet and cause other drain issues, like water leaks and rupturing pipes.</p>
<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the beginning of our house improvements. George and Anthony did a fantastic job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular requirements for our home. I will constantly use them and request George particularly for all future problems or repairs. They were prompt and offered very good rates for what we required done. I highly suggest this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
