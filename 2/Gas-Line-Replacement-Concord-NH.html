<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation of water which might bring unclean water or other, harmful compounds into the general public water supply and private plumbing.

If it is connected to any outdoors water source, Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
