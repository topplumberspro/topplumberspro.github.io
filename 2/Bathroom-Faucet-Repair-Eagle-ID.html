<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
