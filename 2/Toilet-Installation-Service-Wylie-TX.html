<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
