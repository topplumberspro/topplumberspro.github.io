A fantastic way to lower the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal. Quickly and effectively removing leftover potato peels, fruit skins and numerous other types of food waste, the disposal grinds it all into great particles that are eliminated of the chamber and into your home drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>
