<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin.

Again, it is advisable to examine the manufacturer's instructions for special safety measures.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
