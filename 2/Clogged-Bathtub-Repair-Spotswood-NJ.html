<p>Badly set up gas lines result in gas leaks. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. They responded quickly for my sewer leak. Jay B and Aaron scoped the job quickly and discussed the game plan for diagnosis and repair. They kept me informed and persevered through really difficult sewer line clean-up and repair. I will advise SW plumbing for any significant repair work.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
<p>3. Banging or snapping sounds - Over sufficient time, there might be substantial sediment built-up in your water heater that can produce this snapping or popping noise that can be pretty loud. It's a sign that your hot water heater could use a great cleaning and it'll be back to its normal, quiet operation.
