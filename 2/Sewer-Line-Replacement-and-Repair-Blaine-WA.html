<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (normally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
