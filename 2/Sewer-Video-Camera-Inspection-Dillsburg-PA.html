<p>Those of us in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in lots of locations have greatly decreased the variety of reported events that happen within our water supply. This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever actually have been a problem in the very first location. This thinking can be both detrimental and dangerous. Backflow incidents in water supply are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow security. We need to take a look at each installation for the danger it presents and then install the proper defense.</p>

<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily saved for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
