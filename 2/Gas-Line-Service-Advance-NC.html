And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away.

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water flow, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape. Sometimes no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down lead to a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
