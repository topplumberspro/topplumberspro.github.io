<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily stored for later use when need rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
