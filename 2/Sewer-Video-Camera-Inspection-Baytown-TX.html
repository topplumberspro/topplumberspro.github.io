A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other dumping locations. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
