<p>Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is entirely odor-free. The egg smell associated with natural gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are security precautions you ought to require to safeguard yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise allow options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
