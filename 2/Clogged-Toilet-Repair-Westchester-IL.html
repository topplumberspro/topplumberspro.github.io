<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Westchester IL</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in most cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
