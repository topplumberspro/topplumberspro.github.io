The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if essential.

<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Chatham IL</h3>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential licenses released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly need to be checked annually. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an every year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated yearly to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
