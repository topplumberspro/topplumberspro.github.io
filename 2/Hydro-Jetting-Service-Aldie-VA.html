In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.
