Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water hardness can be eliminated fairly quickly by using an ion exchange procedure. Basic water softeners are cation exchange gadgets.

These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
