After a minute, move a smoking cigarettes match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke needs to be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke doesn't draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Turn off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the issue.</p>

There are many different faucet designs, so you may not have the ability to tell what to replace till you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or work with a plumber, this would be a great time to think of whether you wish to upgrade the faucet with a new style.</p>
