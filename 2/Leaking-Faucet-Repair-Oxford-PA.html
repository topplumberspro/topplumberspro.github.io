<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its many desired usages around your house.</p>
