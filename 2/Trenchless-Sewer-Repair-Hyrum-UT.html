<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. For double-bowl sinks, the best way to tackle things is to use a constant waste disposer set consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such sets direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the area of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet kit. Garden hoses that are used to use chemical fertilizers or pesticides are also prone to drawing impurities into your house. If your house was built after 1985, it must be geared up with backflow-preventing hose bibs. If your house is older, you need to check to ensure you have the appropriate protection for outside faucets.</p>
<p>One sure sign that you might need a gas line repair is if there is a really strong, rotten egg-like smell that you just can't identify, it may be time to call Mr. Rooter Plumbing.
