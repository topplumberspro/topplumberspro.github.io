There are 2 standard kinds of toilet flushing systems; both types save water by utilizing 1.6 gallons of water per flush. Gravity-fed flush toilets utilize the force of gravity and a siphon "pull-through" action to clear the bowl. Look for gravity-fed toilets using high performance to effectively and quietly get rid of waste.</p>
