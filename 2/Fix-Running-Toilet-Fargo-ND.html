A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater. To ensure that we are supplying top quality work and customer assurance, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to securely perform water heater replacements.
