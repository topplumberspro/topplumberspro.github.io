Many plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters discover their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, along with some technical direction, each year. Technical guideline consists of safety, local plumbing codes and policies, and blueprint reading. Apprentices likewise study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry.

According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The average per capita water utilize daily is higher in rural counties than urban counties in all the environment regions, except in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with rural areas having less efficient supply of water systems2 primarily due to the relative lack of financial resources to upgrade and preserve their systems.
