Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape.
