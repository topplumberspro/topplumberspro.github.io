Call (866) 701-5306 to schedule a visit. An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not frequently defined by water purveyors.  It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to be located a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often becomes destructive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, specifically in areas where water sits for extended periods of time.

Many residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas hot water heater with unique venting systems also are offered. However they're harder to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>
