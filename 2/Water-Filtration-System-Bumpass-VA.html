It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is extremely crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.
