<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Toilet performance- The greater the performance of the toilet, the more it costs. The performance of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have children, you might not wish to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>The typical service is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older home (constructed pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing, this is a choice to consider. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, however steel eventually experiences deterioration and does not have the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

Hot water heater normally have a sacrificial anode rod that brings in the rusting components and it's possible this rod needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>On average across the country, it costs between $120 and $150 to install a garbage disposal.
