<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular brand-new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
