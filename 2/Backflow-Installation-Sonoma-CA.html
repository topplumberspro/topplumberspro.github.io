If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you need to take to secure yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
