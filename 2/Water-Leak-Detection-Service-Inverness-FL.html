I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
