It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, likewise referred to as tree root invasion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
