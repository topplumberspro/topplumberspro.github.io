Not just can dirty pipes cause your water to drain gradually, but it can also cause pipes to burst and septic tank back-ups. Ensure you don't have a plumbing disaster and ensure your pipes are clean. Check water or air test on system. Air Test: 5 psi or Water Test: 10 foot head of pressure. The test will hold for a minimum of 15 minutes without leakages. 2. DO toss a few lemon or orange peels into your disposal from time to time to help it work properly - and to make your kitchen odor fresh and clean.</p>

Roto-Rooter's specialist plumbers provide a complete range of basement plumbing services and drain cleaning services, but basement floor drain cleaning is one of the most typical. To prep your system for installation, you may have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>In 2009, Roto-Rooter introduced a book titled Chilling Tales From The Porcelain Seat which included "real tales of the odd & inexplicable things that take place and the Roto-Rooter Heroes that can fix them." 5 Roto-Rooter asked its plumbers throughout North America to send true stories about the odd things they have encountered on the job such as odd products recovered from toilets and sewer pipes.
