<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>

The answer is: you need backflow prevention if you have a culinary water connection that might be utilized to supply a lawn sprinkler.</p>
