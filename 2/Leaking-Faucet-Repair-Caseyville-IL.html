<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water circulation, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite circulation is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to get away. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down results in a significant pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
