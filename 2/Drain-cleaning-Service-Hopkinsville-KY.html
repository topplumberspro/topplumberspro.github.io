This has at times resulted in people believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never actually have actually been an issue in the first place. This thinking can be both disadvantageous and dangerous. Backflow occurrences in water supply are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a lowered pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing technique to backflow security.
