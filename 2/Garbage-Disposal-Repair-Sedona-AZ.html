Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to assist the service technician assemble the parts into the body without creating damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lube to ensure the water system is not polluted. Oftentimes the best lubricant is water. The normal use for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be gently lubricated to guarantee they do not roll out of their retainer.
