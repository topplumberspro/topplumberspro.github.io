Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
