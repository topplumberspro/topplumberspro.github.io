<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion.

Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to escape.
