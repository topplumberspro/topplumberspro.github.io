<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). Check the directions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

(Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To prevent this, ensure the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the very same time for about $3.</p>
