<p>Lubrication may assist with the placement of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the service technician assemble the components into the body without producing damage from friction. The lube should be a food grade lube to assure the water system is not infected. Oftentimes the very best lube is water. The usual use for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be lightly lubricated to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using excessive lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out sooner by attracting dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the element. The correct quantity of lubricant must make the surface of the 'ring appear damp. You need to never ever see portions or globs of lube.</p>
