<p>Cured-in location piping is an approach used to repair trenchless relining systems. Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter have the ability to remotely line the area of the pipe that is cracked without having to dig a trench. After the interior of the pipe is cleaned and dried, the installers will apply the lining to the issue area. The liner is cured in place with jets of hot steam as it molds into all the cracks inside the pipe.</p>
