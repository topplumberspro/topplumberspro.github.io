<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the approach set out above. Due to the fact that the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
