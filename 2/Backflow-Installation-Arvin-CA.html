<p>Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is totally odor free. The egg smell connected with natural gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you should require to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
