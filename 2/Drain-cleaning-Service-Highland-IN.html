<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

The test period will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system shall endure the test pressure specified without revealing any evidence of leakage or other defects. Mechanical evaluates utilized to determine test pressures will have a range such that the greatest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need a maximum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be performed using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge noticeable at the time of inspection.
