That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
