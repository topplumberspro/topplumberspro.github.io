<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
