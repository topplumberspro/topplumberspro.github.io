The flapper isn't sealing under normal pressure if pressing down on the flapper stops the sound. Shut off the water, flush the toilet to empty the tank and then run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat. Clean the flush valve seat with an abrasive sponge or ScotchBrite pad if you feel mineral deposits. Don't utilize anything that might roughen it. If cleaning the flush valve seat does not fix the issue, you need to replace the flapper.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. Most water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
