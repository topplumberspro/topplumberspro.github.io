Charging too late causes performance to fall off.</p>

<p>If you're having a brand-new lawn irrigation system installed, you'll need to have the backflow valve evaluated every year going forward.

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 telltale signs of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate over time, they slowly begin to restrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much buildup to occur, so by the time you see it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>
