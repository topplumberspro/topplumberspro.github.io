<p>In community supply of water systems, water is normally maintained at a substantial pressure to enable water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or service. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may occur when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a water or a fire main breaks or some other scenario takes place, infected water may be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention technique used. The best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air space is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is required.

Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
