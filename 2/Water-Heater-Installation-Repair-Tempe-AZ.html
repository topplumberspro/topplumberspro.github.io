<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
