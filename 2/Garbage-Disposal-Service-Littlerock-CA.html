When an individual ends up being a certified tester, there is a good chance the individual knows how to check a backflow preventer. Unfortunately, this does not imply the individual knows how to repair a backflow preventer. Often times it is assumed if you can test them, you can repair them. This is not real. The repair technician has a long list of things he need to learn to be able to repair a backflow prevention assembly and return it to its initial factory requirements.</p>

WaterBoss ® utilizes great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that in fact supply more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to allow optimal capacity in a minimum of space. Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system helps make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also protect the resin bed, so we do not need to lose space on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that permit a churning of resin throughout regeneration to launch dirt, sediment and hardness.</p>
