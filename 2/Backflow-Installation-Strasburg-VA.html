<p>A new water heater will likely last longer, offer you fewer problems, and cost you less to run with time. Slow drains: If you notice that your drains are emptying slower, it might be indicative of the early stages of a clog. A trained plumber would not recommend a replacement unless the initial toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that holds true they might recommend moving toilets to different bathrooms to decrease any future interruptions. Hot water heater must be offered by High 5 Plumbing.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
