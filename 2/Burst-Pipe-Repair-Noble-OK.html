<p>Due to incorrect home appliance installation or a gas line hookup that was refrained from doing effectively. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a new one, getting a brand-new one is more affordable. Plumbing and piping technology has actually enhanced over the last thirty years. Copper has been the preferred choice to replace galvanized iron pipes (which utilized to be considered very strong, but they were discovered to break under pressure and tend to rust within a few years). Today, most quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
