<p>The United States Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home."

<p>pressure vacuum breakers: These are commonly used in industrial plants, cooling towers, laboratories, laundries, pool, lawn sprinkler systems, and fire lawn sprinkler. When water flow stops, pressure vacuum breakers use a check valve developed to close with the aid of a spring. Its air-inlet valve opens when the internal pressure is one psi above air pressure, avoiding non-potable water from being siphoned back into the potable system. The assembly consists of resistant, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
