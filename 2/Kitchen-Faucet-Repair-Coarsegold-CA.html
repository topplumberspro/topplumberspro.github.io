<p>Gas water heaters are simpler to repair than electric ones. A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP garbage disposal system can grind soft, non-fibrous foods.

The cost to install a waste disposal unit in Florida ranges anywhere from $325 to $1,000. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Sluggish drains. A sluggish drain can be a common plumbing problem, and a lot of obstructions can be fixed with a simple fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the easy unclogging methods do not work to solve the sluggish drain, the problem can be a deeper obstruction somewhere in the main sewer line.
