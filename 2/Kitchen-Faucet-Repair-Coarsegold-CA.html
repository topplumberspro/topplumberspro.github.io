In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Sluggish drains. A sluggish drain can be a common plumbing problem, and a lot of obstructions can be fixed with a simple fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning.
