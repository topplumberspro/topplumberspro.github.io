<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
