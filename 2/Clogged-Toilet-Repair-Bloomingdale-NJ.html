Some cities are starting to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and use no drainage, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance since the media can last approximately five years without changing. Salt-based systems need the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>
