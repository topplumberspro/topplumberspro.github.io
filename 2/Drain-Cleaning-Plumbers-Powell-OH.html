<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to assist avoid leaks and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl.
