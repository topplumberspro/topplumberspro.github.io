<p>In many cases, leaks can be sealed by welding or comparable methods. However, if leaks keep springing up in the same length of pipe, then it's likely that you're handling a defect in the pipe, which needs to be changed.

It's in fact fortunate if you find corrosion before a leak occurs, because it gives you time to have actually repiping done before you're confronted with a flood in your home due to a leak.</p>
