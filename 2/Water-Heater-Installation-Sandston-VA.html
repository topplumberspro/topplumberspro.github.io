When your existing set up instant hot water system requires replacement, Bonney's knowledgeable plumbers can replace your instant warm water dispenser or instant hot water heater tank rapidly and economically.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. Most water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>
