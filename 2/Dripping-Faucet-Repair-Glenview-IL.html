<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it should be restored (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
