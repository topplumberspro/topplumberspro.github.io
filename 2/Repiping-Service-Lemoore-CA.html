<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
