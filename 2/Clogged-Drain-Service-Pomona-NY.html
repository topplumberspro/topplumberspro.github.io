<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
