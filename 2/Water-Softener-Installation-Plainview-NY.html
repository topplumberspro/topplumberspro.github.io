The repair professional need to be careful to not develop a backsiphonage condition by draining the water from a higher elevations down to lower elevation.

<p>The most efficient way to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.
