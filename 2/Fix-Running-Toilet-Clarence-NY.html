If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are security preventative measures you must require to secure yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
