<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
