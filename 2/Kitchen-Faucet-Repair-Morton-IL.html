<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
