<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly restored. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated, tough water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Once again, it is suggested to check the producer's directions for unique safety measures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes destructive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, specifically in locations where water sits for extended periods of time.
