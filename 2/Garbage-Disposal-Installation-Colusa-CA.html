<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off.

The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
