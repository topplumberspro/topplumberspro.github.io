<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>

Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new houses, but lots of homes developed between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber when found and changed with another pipe product.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
