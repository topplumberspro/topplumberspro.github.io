Subsequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated yearly. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked each year to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
